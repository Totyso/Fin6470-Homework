    \textbf{1. In class we stated that the equilibrium price of a forward
contract should behave according to the formula \(F_0=S_0e^{rT}\).
Demonstrate that this is true using the arbitrage principle. Assume that
you are dealing with an investment asset that pays no dividends unless
stated otherwise. Specifically, answer the following:}

    \textbf{(a) Suppose \(F_0 > S_0e^{rT}\). Does this imply an arbitrage
opportunity? Explain.}

    Yes, there would be an arbitrage opportunity in the market. Since the
forward and spot contracts are both on the same underlying asset, if
there were some slight disequilibrium in the pricing of the two
contracts, there would be an opportunity for arbitrage.

More specifically, in this example, one could simply sell a forward
contract at time=0, and use the proceeds to buy the underlying in the
spot market. At time=T, what was purchased at the spot price will be
delivered to the buyer of the forward contract, realizing a profit due
to arbitrage.

    \textbf{(b) Now suppose \(F_0 < S_0e^{rT}\). Does this imply an
arbitrage opportunity? Explain.}

    Yes, there would again be an arbitrage opportunity, for the same reason
stated in part (a).

This time, one could sell (short) the underlying in the spot market at
time=0, and use the proceeds to buy a forward contract. At time=T, you
would collect the underlying from the forward contract and return it to
close out the short position, realizing a profit.

    \textbf{(c) Now assume that you are dealing with either a
dividend-paying asset in the form of discrete dollar dividend payments,
or a continuous dividend yield. How does this change the pricing
equation? Explain.}

    With continuous dividends, the formula becomes
\(F_0=S_0e^{(r- \delta) T}\), where \(\delta\) is the dividend yield.
This is becuase the price of the forward must include a provision for
dividends, since the forward contract holder will not collect the
dividends, and thus must pay less for the contract.

    \textbf{(d) Now assume that you are dealing with a consumption commodity
with storage costs, and that holding the physical commodity has certain
benefits (i.e. a convenience yield). How does this change the pricing
equation? Explain.}

    The equation will be just as in part (c), \(F_0=S_0e^{(r- \delta) T}\),
where \(\delta\) is the convenience yield. As in part (c), the holder of
the physical commodity has the ability to use the commodity as needed,
which is why they pay a convenience yield that acts similarly to a
dividend with a stock, and the forward contract holder will pay less for
the contract as they are giving up this convenience yield.

    \textbf{(e) In class we argued that all of this depends upon the
possibility of physical delivery of the contract, which guarantees that
\(F_T=S_T\),that is that the futures price at maturity is equal to the
spot price at maturity. First, explain why that is. Second, what would
happen if \(F_T \neq S_T\)? Carefully explain.}

    At time=T, \(F_T=S_T\) must hold because the two trades would be exact
substitutes for eachother. In other words, at expiry the futures
contract now behaves exactly like a spot trade, as the time to expiry is
0. If this is not the case, there would be a very quick and easy
arbitrage opportunity. One could simply sell the overpriced contract and
use the proceeds to buy the underpriced contract, making a profit at
time=T with no risk and infinite upside. This would occur until supply
and demand forced the two to return to equilibrium.

    \textbf{(f) Consider a new kind of forward contract called a prepaid
forward. It is very similar to a standard forward contract. The only
difference is that the long party pays the short party at time \(t=0\),
but still takes delivery from the short party at \(t=T\). How must the
standard pricing formula be modified to properly price the prepaid
forward? Carefully explain your logic. Why would anyone ever want to
transact in such a contract? Do we actually see prepaid forward
contracts in the real world, or only in finance textbooks?}

    A normal forward price is shown to be the future value of the spot
price, since that is when money will be collected. Since a prepaid
forward contract seller collects the proceeds at time=0, the price of
the prepaid forward contract is simply \(F^P_{0,T}=S_0\). The holder of
the prepaid contract will however also not collect dividends paid, so if
a discrete dividend were introduced, the formula will change to
\(F^P_{0,T}=S_0 - \Sigma^n_{i=1} PV_0 D_{t_i}\), and with continuous
dividends \(F^P_{0,T}=S_0e^{-\delta T}\).

Data. In it you will find historical nearby daily settlement futures
prices as well as daily New York Harbor spot prices for WTI Crude Oil

    \textbf{(a) Test the series for unit roots using the Augmented
Dickey-Fuller test. Conduct the tests for prices in levels, and first
price differences. Also conduct the test in log-price levels and

    I also fail to reject the null hypothesis of a unit-root for the futures
series. This also makes sense, since as we saw in question 1 the futures
price is just the future value of the spot price, so since the spot
series is a random walk, the futures series should be as well.

    I reject the null.

    Each of the series that is not a first-difference contains a unit-root,
which is what I expected as explained individually above.

    The cointegrating vector is {[}1, -0.9929{]}. This shows that the series
is cointegrated, as there is a parameter 0.9929 that is explaining the
movement of the basis spread. The ADF Statistic of -14.7749 shows there
is very strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis of a unit-root in
the cointegrating relationship. This means there should be a trading
strategy on the basis of oil should this spread deviate from its
long-run mean.

    We see in this time series that the dynamic hedge is very dynamic. The
hedge varies greatly just in the year 1993. Pirrong argues that this
minimum variance hedge is the best situation for MGRM, who instead used
a 1 for 1 hedge ratio. I find it interesting that the ratio does
approach 1 at multiple points in the minimum variance hedge, but also
gets down to 0.70. Since MGRM had superior knowledge to the rest of the
market, a minimum variance hedge would have kept their profits more
stable, but with the 1 for 1 hedge they had the ability to skew their
distribution in a positive manner, leading to a much more positive
expected return while only increasing the left tail by a small amount.
Though Pirrong does have a point about the dynamic nature of the daily
hedge, I do not agree with him when he says that MGRM was not hedging by
using the 1 for 1 ratio.

    \textbf{3. In this problem you will simulate values for spot prices and
basis for heating oil and gasoline following the models of Bollen and
Whaley in their paper Simulating Supply (which is in the readings
file).}

    \textbf{(a) Simulate 45 days of prices for spot and daily settlement
prices for futures (via the basis equation). Looking at figure 1 in the
paper use initial values of 0.69 for heating oil and 0.80 for gasoline.
Use an initial value for heating oil basis of −0.02 and −0.01 for
gasoline. See Table 2 in the paper for the other parameter values.}

    Yes the pairs are cointegrated. Since futures prices are a derivative of
the underlying, there must be a cointegrating relationship between them,
which is the basis. The basis is just the spread between the two, or
\(F_{i,t} = S_{i,t} * e^{b_{i,t}}\). Since this is the case, clearly the
futures price will move with the spot price.

It can be clearly seen in the graphs above that there is also a
cointegrating relationship between heating oil and gasoline. The
relationship is clear in the spot, futures, and the basis.

    \textbf{4. Describe the institutional differences between forward
markets and futures markets. Describe the historical evolution of
futures markets and the institutional features that define futures

{\color{incolor}In [{\color{incolor}172}]:} \PY{c+c1}{\PYZsh{} Chapter 5 Mcdonald \PYZhy{} Neoclassical perspective}
\end{Verbatim}


    Forwards and futures are different only by a couple of key aspects.
Forward contracts are between 2 specific parties, rather than through an
exchange like futures contracts. Also, forward contracts can be
customized to include very specific features such as quantities to be
exchanged, dates, or more unique features desired by the traders.
Futures contracts, since they are traded on an exchange, are
standardized. This does improve liquidity of the contracts, however, and
it is much easier to unwind your position.

In his paper 'The Origin of Futures Markets', Williams discusses some
history of futures markets. The Chicago Board of Trade officially traded
futures in 1865, however there is evidence of futures trades occuring
much earlier than that. There were contracts stated as 'To-arrive'
contracts that look just like futures contracts. These were written on a
large variety of commodities. There is even evidence of options traded
on futures contracts as early as 1847.

There is strong evidence in the mid-1800s that futures trading occurred
even more often than physical trading. 'To-arrive' contracts and future
delivery contract volume far exceeded physical volume, even in the
dullest of trading days. Rather than increments like the physical
markets, futures contracts were traded in round lots of sizes like 100,
500 or 1000. This is evidence that traders weren't interested as much in
how much of the commodity they would be receiving, but how easily they
could offset the position. This is clear evidence that traders were
speculating rather than trading for hedging purposes.

Since The Chicago Board of Trade officially traded futures, markets have
grown extensively. There are now futures on commodities, currencies,
stocks, bonds, and much more. Though markets are much more advanced
today, there seems to have always been a need to trade forward, and not
only for hedging, but for speculative purposes. This comes down to
Hayek's 'The Knowledge Problem'. Futures prices were needed to relay
information regarding future prices of commodities, and for that reason
we can see a history of futures markets much further back than many
studies suggest.

Contrary to most studies, Williams believes that futures markets have
been in existence for a long time. From the papers we have read thus far
this semester, I would tend to agree with Williams, even though futures
exchanges haven't existed for as long as evidence can be shown of
futures trades.

Williams also argues that there is essentially no difference between
futures contracts and forward contracts. I will touch on this briefly as
I have already stated the mechanical difference in the first paragraph.
In his paper, Williams states that the 'To-arrive' contracts being
traded were almost standarized, which does point more towards futures
contracts. Since there are only mechanical differences in these
contracts, I agree with Williams that they are essentially the same.

Futures exchanges can also rely on a Clearing House to match and
reconcile trades of futures contracts. The Clearing House will ensure
financial integrity to remove the risk of non-payment at time=T. The
Clearinghouse will also increase liquidity, adding to this advantage of
futures contracts over forward contracts. A Clearing House works by
depositing large sums of money into a guarantee fund as insurance for
any potential non-payment. Any clearing members must be members of an
exchange, and they must purchase shares of the exchange. Any exchange
members who are not clearing members must clear trades through a
clearing member and pay a fee.

Price Relations Among Hog, Corn, and Soybean Meal Futures.}

\end{Verbatim}


    \textbf{(a) What were the main empirical findings of the paper? What
statistical and econometric methods were used by the author? Were you
persuaded by the author's evidence?}

    The paper first tests each of the three series for stationarity using a
unit-root test. The results fail to reject the null hypothesis of a
unit-root. They then first difference each of the respective series and
subject each first differenced series to the unit-root test and reject
each at at least the 5\% significance level, suggest each is integrated
of order 1.

Next, a multivariate cointegration test is used to test if the three
series are cointegrated. The test we are familiar with from class is the
Engle-Granger test for cointegration, which uses the residuals from a
regression of series and subjects them to the Augmented Dickey-Fuller
test to find if the spread is integrated of order 0. The paper uses more
advanced econometric models, but rejects the null hypothesis that the
series are not cointegrated.

The paper finds that lean hog, corn and soybean meal futures are
cointegrated in the presence of significant time trends and seasonal
factors. The cointegrating vector results from this test are a little
different than the Gross Hog Feeding Margin calculated earlier in the
paper, and this can be explained since farmers don't exclusively feed
corn and soybean meal to hogs, but also include a variety of other foods
that aren't available in the futures market to include in the hog
spread.

The error-correction model is estimated for each of the variations
included in the spread, and then a strategy is formulated by buying
(selling) hog when hog is underpriced (overpriced) relative to corn and
soybean meal and selling (buying) corn and soybean meal. The strategy
shows there is profit to be made in the strategy.

The strategy works because of inefficiencies in the market for these
futures. The paper explicitly states that if traders knew of this
cointegrating relationship between these contracts, the spread would be
traded until the inefficiencies were taken away, indicating a view that
markets are not in equilibrium but are working their way towards
equilibrium, closer to a neoclassical view of market efficiency.

I would not invest in this trading strategy for a few reasons. First,
though there is a clear cointegrating relationship between hog, corn and
soybean meal futures, I am wary of all of the possible substitutes for
either of these food options for hogs. If there were to be a global
shortage of corn, farmers could easily substitute for one of the many
other options listed in the paper, which isn't even all-inclusive. So if
I were to be short hog and long corn and soybean, I don't believe there
would be a strong enough error-correction in the price of hog to make up
for the losses that could be endured for extreme conditions that affect
only corn or soybean supply.

Also, as stated in the paper, as more traders seek this arbitrage
opportunity, the opportunity will fade. As soon as this paper was
published, I would believe many arbitrageurs would see if before me and
start trading the spread. So if I did try to invest, I believe the
profit to be made would have already dissipated.

Bayes' rule is important here since traders either have a prior view
that markets are effiecient or they have a prior view that markets are
inefficient. Prior to this paper, I had a prior belief that markets were
inefficient, but wouldn't have thought of a trading strategy such as the
hog spread. The paper did move my prior, as I would not have previously
thought of trading this spread should it have been suggested to me until
I saw the econometric models in the paper showing the clear
cointegrating relationship. The strategy, when implemented from
1985-2001 is profitable almost 90\% of the times the spread is traded.
Though this was good evidence, it was not enough out-of-sample evidence
for me with no clear predictive density to show the real risk inherent
in the strategy, and is the final reason the paper would not convince me
to invest my own money in the hog spread.

    \textbf{(b) At the beginning of the course we read the appendix on the
history of thought on equilibrium concepts in economics from Culp's book
Risk Transfer, in which the author states ``it becomes quite hard to
explain a lot of financial and derivatives market activity without being
a little bit Austrian.'' How does that idea apply to the empirical
findings of Liu? Do you think that statement is true? Can you give Liu's
econometric model (the error-correction model) a neo-Austrian
interpretation?}

    The neo-Classical belief is that markets are in a stationary state of
equilibrium. If this is the case, there would be no arbitrage
opportunities in either spot or derivatives markets. Markets would also
be efficient, and all investors would be best off if they took very
passive strategies and just invested in the market as a whole.
Derivatives markets may not even exist, as we see implied in the paper
by Quintana, Carvalho, Scott, and Costigliola.

Austrians believe that markets trend towards equilibrium. This is what I
believe is the statement that Culp is trying to make when he says that
markets can only be explained if you look at it from at least a small
Austrian perspective. This to me makes a lot more sense, as markets have
inefficiencies in them that are exploited daily by hedge funds, traders
and market-makers.

This statement applies to the empirical findings by Liu, as the
cointegrating relationship between the 3 commodities under scrutiny are
not constantly in a stationary state, but they trend towards a constant
spread. This is a clear Austrian view of markets, and shows an arbitrage
opportunity in the futures markets based on this Austrian
interpretation.

The error-correction model is a great example of the Austrian
perspective at work. The lambda paramater works as the error-correction
variable that pulls the futures prices back into equilibrium. Though
there will be a mean-reverting trend in the spread, they are not in a
state of stationary equilibrium, as the neo-Classicals would suggest.

    \textbf{(c) At the end of the paper Liu conducts some trading
simulations. Outline the methodology that Liu uses to conduct these
trading simulations. Why is that necessary? Do you find the simulations
convincing? Would you place real money on his trading model? If not,
what would it take to convince you that the model really is predictive
of abnormal profits?}

    Liu's trading simulations are based off of the residuals obtained from
his error-correction model. He has 4 different simulations where he
takes the standard deviation of the residuals and multiplies it by 0.25,
0.5, 0.75, and 1. In each respective model, when the spread between the
futures prices crosses the upperbound determined by the respective
multiple, one commodity is sold short and the proceeds are used to
purchase the other commodity. This is the trigger mentioned in the
paper. Once the spread returns to its long-run mean, the position is
reversed, and the profits are realized as shown in table VII. Each
respective strategy is shown to make money on average, though some
positions are entered for much longer than others.

It is necessary to conduct these simulations to show that the strategy
will work out-of-sample, rather than just data-snooping by showing that
the results would work over the in-sample time period. The simulations
seem very convincing, with significant returns and very small p-values
for each respective strategy.

In the time period the paper was written, I would definitely place real
money on his trading model. The error-correction method shown in the
paper has great econometrics behind it, and shows that there is a true
cointegrating relationship between the 3 commodities. The strategy is a
great way to simulate profits made by a hog breeder, and I believe the
out-of-sample simulations provide sufficient evidence of abnormal
returns regardless of the condition of the market. I would be wary,
however, to invest once the paper is published, as this would result in
many other traders searching for the same abnormal returns, which could
take away the arbitrage opportunity and result in 0 or negative profit.

    \textbf{6. In class we discussed the case of oil hedging by
Metalgesellschaft (MG). In their paper Metalgesellschaft and the
Economics of Synthetic Storage Culpand Miller defended MG's hedging
strategy. Pirrong strongly criticized Culp and Miller's findings in his
paper Metalgesellschaft: Prudent Hedger Ruined, or a Wildcatter on
NYMEX?. Please answer the following questions about the debate over MG's
hedging strategy.}

    \textbf{(a) Culp \& Miller called MG's main hedging strategy Synthetic
Storage. Please outline the basics of this strategy, and explain how it
differs from risk minimizing hedging. In your explanation, you may want
to reference the ideas of the economist Holbrook Working cited by Culp
\& Miller regarding hedging strategies and the motives for hedging.}

    \textbf{(b) One of the main points of disagreement between Culp \&
Miller and their critics, especially Pirrong, is over the proper hedge
ratio for MG's hedging strategy. What do you think the correct hedge
ratio was for MG? Can you outline an empirical strategy for estimating
the proper hedge ratio? Explain.}

    \textbf{(c) At the end of his paper, Pirrong states ``Given the huge
losses incurred in late 1993, a Bayesian estimating the probability
distribution of MG's information advantage would almost certainly place
little weight on the possibility that the firm was well informed, and
great weight on the possibility that it did not possess superior
information, regardless of the charitability of his priors concerning
the prescience of MG's managers.'' Why do you think Pirrong invokes
Bayes' Rule? Comment on this statement by Pirrong.}

    \textbf{(d) Relate your answer in part (c) to the concept of the
predictive distribution. What is the importance of the predictive
distribution in this hedging application?}

    \textbf{(e) Energy markets such as the oil market are often historically
characterized by backwardation, but have also had long periods of
contango. Does that matter for MG's synthetic storage strategy?
Explain.}

    \textbf{7. Consider the following two papers:}

\begin{verbatim}
i. Orange Juice and Weather by Richard Roll.
ii. Is Sound Just Noise? by Coval & Shumway.
\end{verbatim}

    \textbf{Both papers deal with the informational role of prices in a
market setting. Relate the findings of each paper to the main idea in
Hayek's paper The Use of Knowledge in Society. Does the evidence in the
article support Hayek's main thesis? If so, how? Explain. Be careful to
give an economic interpretation to any statistical or econometric
measure used in the article. Also, explain the data that were used in
the respective study.}

    \textbf{Orange Juice and Weather by Richard Roll}

    Orange Juice and Weather talks about how orange juice futures prices
reflect information gained through weather reports. Orange juice is a
great subject for this study, since 98\% of orange juice concentrate in
the US is produced in the Orlando, Florida region, so weather patterns
in that region would have a large impact on nationwide orange juice
prices. The paper specifies that farmers' planting decisions and prices
of fertilizer and petroleum have minimal if any effect on orange juice
prices, providing more evidence that the orange juice is right for this
study of weather.

Hayek's paper about The Knowledge Problem talks about how knowledge can
best be distributed in society. This paper relates directly in that
knowledge of the impact of weather patterns can be directly spread
throughout society through orange juice futures prices. Orange trees in
Florida cannot handle freezing temperatures for a sustained amount of
time, and need a substantial amount of rainfall. This means that when
there is an expected period of freezing temperatures, future supply of
orange juice will decline, which should have an immediate and
significant impact on orange juice futures prices.

One more important note before I get into the discussion on the
relevance of price information reflecting weather patterns is the price
fluctuation limit imposed on orange juice futures by the exchange. There
is a limit restricting trading on the futures if there is too large of a
price fluctuation to limit large gains or losses in a single trading
day. Though this does theoretically help those with large positions, if
we look back at Hayek's paper on The Use of Knowledge in Society, this
is a very inefficient way to deal with the spread of information. When a
limit is imposed, the days that trading is halted, information flow is
also halted for the rest of the day and prices are then very inefficient
though there is no opportunity in the market to gain from the
inefficiency. The paper deals with this issue by looking at the closing
prices of the next non-limit day and taking it back to the limit-days to
try its best to reflect the information, but it is still an inefficiency
when looked at from Hayek's perspective.

The evidence in the article shows that futures from 2-6 months in range
do reflect information regarding weather impacts on orange juice futures
prices. However, there is only a statistically significant impact on
temperature patterns, particularly when freezing temperatures occur. We
would have an a priori belief that only freezing temperatures would have
a significant effect on orange juice futures prices, however
non-freezing temperature patterns reveal some predictive probability
that future weather will exhibit freezing temperatures, which explains
why all available weather information provides predictive information
for orange juice futures prices.

Rainfall is not as efficient in predicting prices for a couple of
reasons. First, weather forecasts available to the public only state
whether or not there will be any amount of rainfall, not the specified
amounts, leaving great variability in the information conveyed. Second,
it is much easier to provide more water to oranges if there should be a
drought, and only very severe conditions like a Hurricane would provide
enough water to do any damage to orange crops. This is why the
t-statistic is low when looking at the impact of rainfall forecasts on
orange juice futures prices.

The data used in the study was the futures prices on orange juice
concentrate from 2-6 month contracts, as well as public weather
forecasts on weather patterns. There were separate tables for AM and PM
information, as most of the predictive power came from the PM forecasts,
since that is when the freezing temperatures would occur. The paper also
looked at maximum and minimum forecasts for each day and used lagged
variables to show the predictive power from one day to the next and the
possibility of extended freezing temperatures.

Though there is statistical evidence that cold weather does influence
futures prices, the amount of variation explained is still a small
amount. In fact Roll looked at many other factors that could potentially
impact futures prices such as correlation to oil prices, economic
downturns, and foreign currency exchange rates. Though many of these
were significant, weather patterns showed the most predictive roll in
predicting futures prices. Though with all of these factors included in
the model, only 27\% of the variability in prices was shown, to which
most is attributed to the temperature forecasts. Going back to Hayek's
paper, this shows that much more information is being reflected in
prices that even advanced econometric models can't capture. However, it
is important to note that the weather patterns are in fact providing
relevant information to traders regarding price movements.

    \textbf{Is Sound Just Noise? by Coval \& Shumway}

    Is Sound Just Noise? was written in a time period when the majority of
trading still occurred in trading pits with traders yelling at eachother
to buy or sell different positions. The study looked at the 30-year
treasury bond futures trading pit, and tested multiple hypotheses
regarding information that could be gained from the sound decibel level
observed in the pit at any given time. They believed that noise was a
precursor for increased volume, price movements, and decreased depth.
They also believed it reflected anxiety that traders had to unwind their
large positions by the end of the day.

The mere hypotheses proposed in this paper are greatly in-line with
Hayek's notion that available information is shown in prices. Coval and
Shumway note that as exchanges started shifting more towards electronic
trading, much of this information would be lost in prices. One example
given in the paper is when the 10-year treasury note pit was moved about
25 feet away from the pit under scrutiny. Traders complained that they
no longer knew what was going on in the recently adjacent pit, and had
less information to trade on. When screens were placed in their pit to
try to relay this information, they went unused, showing that it was the
noise the traders were looking for.

Again referencing Hayek's paper, this noise was one of the most
efficient ways for traders to relay information through prices. When the
pits got very loud, this meant there was greater anxiety for traders to
get their orders filled, and the volume increased to show this, leading
to more efficient prices.

Looking at the paper from a more technical aspect, each of the
hypotheses was tested, and then retested with many different lags,
including the Akaike Information Criterion, and this showed significant
results that were unchanged by the number of lags chosen. It showed that
with an increase in the standard deviation of sound of 1, there was a
17\% increase in the probability of a price change of 2 ticks or
greater. This is statistically and economically significant. In simpler
terms, this means that an increase in sound volatility is almost
definitely reflected in near-future prices.

The study also concluded that sound can predict supply and demand
schedules, as well as future market depth. However most importantly, it
shows that traders are not focusing only on readily available
information such as past prices and news announcements, but are also
focused on sound, as well as many other unrecognized factors not looked
at in the paper. This is a notion that Hayek would readily support,
showing that knowledge is vastly shown in prices.

    \textbf{8. Read the paper Futures markets, Bayesian forecasting and risk
modeling by Quintana, Carvalho, Scott, and Costigliola. Relate the main
idea of the paper to the articles that we have read in this course and
the themes that we have developed. There is a technical aspect to this
paper. Don't get bogged down in the technical details, instead focus on
the main ideas and concepts.}

    The main idea of this paper is to discuss whether markets are strong
form efficient, or in other words they are always in equilibrium, or if
there are inefficiencies allowing for market-makers to exist. The paper
takes a strong Bayesian perspective. The paper also suggests, as we have
discussed in class, that markets are not in equilibrium, but are
continuously moving towards equilibrium through price discovery as
traders are incorporating new information into their trades and
market-makers are setting bid and ask prices appropriately to
continuously incorporate this new information.

This process is a Bayesian model as market-makers and traders alike are
constantly updating their Bayesian models to incorporate new information
and rely less on their priors. The predictive density for payoffs is
informed and traders can see the probabilistic graph of their possible
returns.

Unless market incoherencies are identified, the only way to beat the
market is to increase your risk respective to the market. These
incoherencies are arbitrage opportunities that are taken by traders that
help the markets reach equilibrium. These opportunities are also why
market-makers can exist. Without inefficiencies, trades would be
essentially extinct as there would be no expected return greater than
the market return, and traders would have very passive strategies. This
would cause all trades to be done to occur with no spreads, otherwise
the trades wouldn't occur, thus eliminating the role of market-makers
for lack of profitability.

The paper discusses the role that futures markets play as Bayesian
market-makers by quoting fair prices that represent and incorporate all
relevant information regarding future expectations of the underlying
commodities. The paper mentions how individual traders may not have all
the information, but all the traders together become an intelligent
market-maker, and this role is reflected in the futures markets.
According to the effiecient markets hypothesis, this is a state of
equilibrium whereupon market efficiency cannot be improved.

This futures market as a Bayesian market-maker can be bet against simply
by buying or selling futures contracts. If you believed markets were in
disequilibrium as is mentioned in the paper, and all information was not
reflected in prices, you could buy a futures contract if you believed
there was information withheld from the market that would increase the
spot commodity to a price higher than the futures price at expiry, or
sell a futures contract if you believed there was information moving
markets in the opposite direction.

This discussion comes back to Hayek's discussion of The Use of Knowledge
in Society. Hayek believed prices reflected information, and this is
exactly what is being discussed in this paper. Even if there are
temporary inefficiencies, traders will act quickly on these
opportunities and cause markets to push closer to an equilibrium. Hayek
would agree that the futures market is acting as a single market maker,
reflecting available information regarding future prices of underlying
commodities and providing fair trades in the futures prices.

    \textbf{9. In class we have spoken about innovations in the derivatives
markets. Comment on what you think will be the shape of innovations in
derivatives markets in the next two decades. What things that are not
now traded on exchanges, or with derivatives that you think will be? How
will this facilitate global commerce? Outline a business strategy that
does not now exist that you think someday might soon exist if
derivatives markets are created. What is the role for data and data
analysis in your proposal?}
